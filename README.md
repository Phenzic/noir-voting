## ZK Voting

This repo contains a step by step walkthrough towards a full fledged ZK DApp to allow anonymous voting.

### Repo Structure

If you take a look at the existing branches, you'll see that there are multiple numbered branches. They build on top of each other, starting from 0-overview (the one you're in, right now).

Each branch has its own readme, like this one, with an overview of the progress made towards the final DApp.

Also, if you go to the pull requests, every branch has a PR to the previous one, which is useful to see the diff.

### Circuit Overview

Some of the topics we'll cover in this walkthrough are:

* Identity commitments
* Merkle tree - Proof of Inclusion
* Smart Contracts - Depolyment and Testing
